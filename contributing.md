Make sure you are in the project folder path. Then, go to the master branch and pull the last changes.
```sh
cd C:\Users\Usuario\Documents\GitHub\Frontend-Web-Application-RepairNow
git checkout master
git pull
```
Then go to your branch where you will work. Or create a new branch. And merge the master branch into your branch.
```sh
git checkout -b "newBranch"
git merge master
```
Finally, make your changes, commit each change with its respective message, and push your changes to your branch.
```sh
git add .
git commit -a -m "new changes message"
git push origin newBranch
